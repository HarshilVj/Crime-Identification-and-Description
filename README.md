# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Crime-Identification-and-sceneDescription
Crime Identification and Description Using BiLSTM, MediaPipe, and InternVideo v2.5
This project focuses on automatic crime detection and description from video footage.
It combines a BiLSTM-based classifier (trained on pose landmarks extracted via MediaPipe Holistic) with a pretrained multimodal LLM (InternVideo v2.5) to generate natural language descriptions of detected activities.
We focus on distinguishing between two different types of crimes which were generating an extraordinary accuracy of about 98% as compared with multi-class classification accuracy (around 85%) , that are:
Shoplifting
Vandalism
The system aims to provide both a predicted crime label and a human-readable description for better interpretability in real-world surveillance and security applications majorly in public place like supermarkets, grocery stores, etc., where there are two primarily crimes shoplifting and vandalism.

The system processes video inputs and outputs:
- Predicted crime class
- A detailed, human-readable description of the event

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone This Repository

git clone https://github.com/HarshilVj/Crime-Detection-and-Description.git

### 2. Install Required Packages
Install all the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
pip install decord av imageio
pip install transformers==4.40.1 timm accelerate
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation  # (Optional for speed boost)

### 3. Add Trained Models
Place the trained crime detection model:
crime_detection_model_2class.h5 (trained model)

The model was trained using a sequence of python scripts as provided in crime_training.
Make sure you have a Hugging Face token (free account) for loading InternVideo. Set it like this in the code:
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "your_huggingface_token"


## üìã How It Works
1. Pose Landmark Extraction-
The system uses MediaPipe Holistic to detect:

       Body pose (33 points)
       Left and right hand landmarks (21 points each)
       These are stacked into a 225-dimensional feature vector per frame.

2. Crime Prediction
A custom-built BiLSTM + Attention model processes 100 frames and predicts the crime type.

3. Event Description
InternVideo generates a detailed description tailored to the predicted crime, leveraging a series of frames from the video.

4. Visualization
Frames are shown with the predicted crime class overlaid for visual confirmation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Output Visualizations/Result
Once the model is completely trained and set up, for evry new input/video stream you will see:

üîπ Predicted Crime Class (example: Shoplifting)

üìù Description (example: "The individual discreetly hides merchandise into their bag without making a payment.")

Frames will be displayed with real-time overlays.

## üìà Model Performance

Metric	Value-
Achieved an extraoridinary Classification Accuracy around	98% for such a noisy and blurred dataset(for two class classification i.e. Shoplifting and Vandalism).
Description Quality	were also almost Human-like.
